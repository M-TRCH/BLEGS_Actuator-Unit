BLEGS â€“ BLDC-based Leg Execution & Guidance System

1) Project Description
The BLEGS project focuses on developing a compact and efficient actuation system for robotic leg movement using Brushless DC (BLDC) motors. The system is designed to deliver precise, responsive, and energy-efficient control of leg joints, enabling dynamic motion such as walking, balancing, or directional adjustment.

2) Key features include
2.1 SVPWM-based Motor Control: Implementation of Sinusoidal Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) to drive the BLDC motor smoothly with minimal torque ripple.
2.2 Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Operation: Support for both open-loop operation (for testing and system bring-up) and closed-loop control using feedback from encoders or sensors.
2.3 Position & Trajectory Guidance: Real-time command inputs or pre-programmed trajectories to guide the leg's movement with high resolution.
2.4 Compact Embedded Integration: Designed for microcontrollers (e.g., STM32G4) with optimized real-time control loops and PWM generation.
2.5 Flexible Architecture: Modular design allows adaptation to different leg structures (1-DOF or multi-DOF), making it suitable for walking robots, prosthetics, or academic research.

3) Project Goals
3.1 Build a stable BLDC motor control module for joint actuation.
3.2 Implement real-time control algorithms (SVPWM, inverse kinematics, etc.).
3.3 Achieve smooth, accurate leg movement with minimal latency.
3.4 Ensure modularity for future integration with full robotic platforms.

4) Expected Outcomes
4.1 A working prototype of a single robotic leg joint driven by a BLDC motor.
4.2 Software stack for SVPWM motor control and motion planning.
4.3 Testing framework to evaluate motion accuracy and control stability.
4.4 Video demonstrations and documentation for academic/research use.
